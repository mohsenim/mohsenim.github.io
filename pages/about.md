<h1 class="mx-auto" style="font-family:Courgette;">{{ page.title }}</h1>

I'm a Machine Learning Specialist and Data Engineer focused on:

* Extracting insights from complex data through analytical modeling
* Building data pipelines to deploy ML solutions at scale

My expertise spans machine learning, data engineering, and deep learning, including Generative AI and LLMs. I design and deploy intelligent systems for text, image, and time-series data using modern MLOps and DevOps practices.

With hands-on experience in research and product development, Iâ€™ve worked on time series analysis, anomaly detection, transformer-based models, long-text structuring, abstractive summarization, and end-to-end neural architectures. I'm also experienced in applying retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for recommendation systems.

I build robust pipelines from data ingestion to scalable deployment, with a strong focus on automation, testing, and monitoring in production environments.

I share insights on [Medium](https://mohsenim.medium.com/), connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohsenim), and publish code on [GitHub](https://github.com/mohsenim).
This site brings all my work together in one place.
