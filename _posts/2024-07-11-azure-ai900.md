description: "I was offered a package of training programs covering several Microsoft Azure certificates. In a few posts, I’m going to explain each of these Azure certificates from the perspective of a data science and ML expert. The first post covers the Microsoft Azure Fundamentals certificate (AZ-900). I had access to official training by Microsoft and the learning material on learn.microsoft.com. Since the official learning material published on on learn.microsoft.com is the source for the exam, I will refer to the topics covered there."
