To add full logging and monitoring to a project, I reviewed the Grafana doc and evaluated various tooling options. Reaching a coherent, end-to-end observability architecture is nontrivial for two reasons:

• The ecosystem offers many tool and deployment combinations.
• Documentation mixes component details with Grafana Cloud promotion.

The following summarizes the tooling and architecture I selected to build a fully open-source observability stack while keeping the option to move to Grafana Cloud.

Modern microservice environments demand more than basic uptime checks. Robust systems require full observability, extending beyond traditional logging and monitoring.
