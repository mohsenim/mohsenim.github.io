### Hi, Welcome!

I design, build, and operate AI, machine learning (ML), and data-driven systems, delivering end-to-end solutions for natural language processing, time series analysis, and large language models.

I have experience as a freelance Data Scientist and AI/ML Engineer, creating production-ready models, automated pipelines, and scalable deployment setups across different clients. My work emphasizes MLOps best practices, microservice-based architectures, and cloud-native solutions on Azure.

Despite extensive experience in production systems, I maintain a junior mindset, always curious, always learning, and eager to explore new technologies.

I share insights on [Medium](https://mohsenim.medium.com/), connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mohsenim), and publish code on [GitHub](https://github.com/mohsenim).
This site brings all my work together in one place.
