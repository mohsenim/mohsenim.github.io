- name: Time Series Forecasting — Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS)
  id: acivity1
  description: >
    Many forecasting models use least squares or its variants to minimize prediction errors, treating over- and under-predictions the same. But in practice, the stakes often differ — and single-point predictions don’t reveal how confident the model is.In this post, I turn to parametric models. These assume a specific distribution and predict its parameters directly. In my latest post, I walk through how this works and introduce CRPS — a loss function designed for training such probabilistic models.

  id: activity2
  description: >
    Traditional forecasting treats over- and under-predictions equally, but in real-world scenarios like financial markets, the costs can differ significantly. Quantile forecasting addresses this by estimating confidence intervals, offering a nuanced view of uncertainty. In my latest post, I explore how this method works and cover its advantages.

  description: >
    MLflow is widely recognized as a powerful tool for tracking machine learning (ML) experiments, enabling data scientists and ML experts to systematically log metrics, parameters, and models. However, its capabilities extend beyond these traditional use cases — MLflow can also be used to track datasets.
