- name: Achieving Full Observability with the Grafana Ecosystem
  id: acivity1
  description: >
    Reaching a coherent, end-to-end observability architecture using the Grafana ecosystem is nontrivial for two reasons: The ecosystem offers many tool and deployment combinations, and the documentation mixes component details with Grafana Cloud promotion. This post summarizes the tooling and architecture I selected to build a fully open-source observability stack while keeping the option to move to Grafana Cloud.

- name: Data Access Layer Abstraction with Apache Spark
  id: acivity2
  description: >
    How do you build data processing systems that serve multiple customers with varying storage, compute, and scaling need, without rewriting your core logic each time? In this post, I show how Apache Spark can be used not just for large-scale data processing, but also as an abstraction layer for data access. This approach helps simplify architecture, isolate customer-specific differences, and reduce onboarding and maintenance costs, based on hands-on insights from real projects.

- name: Time Series Forecasting — Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS)
  id: acivity3
  description: >
    Many forecasting models use least squares or its variants to minimize prediction errors, treating over- and under-predictions the same. But in practice, the stakes often differ — and single-point predictions don’t reveal how confident the model is.In this post, I turn to parametric models. These assume a specific distribution and predict its parameters directly. In my latest post, I walk through how this works and introduce CRPS — a loss function designed for training such probabilistic models.

- name: Time Series Forecasting — Quantile Forecasting — Quantile Loss
  id: activity4
  description: >
    Traditional forecasting treats over- and under-predictions equally, but in real-world scenarios like financial markets, the costs can differ significantly. Quantile forecasting addresses this by estimating confidence intervals, offering a nuanced view of uncertainty. In my latest post, I explore how this method works and cover its advantages.

#     MLflow is widely recognized as a powerful tool for tracking machine learning (ML) experiments, enabling data scientists and ML experts to systematically log metrics, parameters, and models. However, its capabilities extend beyond these traditional use cases — MLflow can also be used to track datasets.
